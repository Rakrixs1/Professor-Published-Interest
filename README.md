<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If the user is a student it can provide information when seeking out professors in the area of interest by filtering out keywords. The student will be able to use the US map to hover over information demonstrating the professor in the top spot for published keywords. The student can also use the tree map to filter out by state. The tree map will then demonstrate the top used keyword  for a university in that state, among other universities. When the student chooses a keyword from the tree map they can use the keyword dropdown to search for a specific keyword. This will display information in a bar chart of top citations among professors in the us. If the student will like more information regarding the specific professor of their choice they can use the faculty dropdown to view the accumulated citations for that professor. Once the professor of their choice is selected, the student will be able to contact them using the information on the data table on the bottom of the webpage. 

If the user is a professor it can provide information on their collegues and themselves. By using the keyword dropdown the professor can compare among other collegues. They will also be able to select their name to give visibility of accumulated number of citations they have.
